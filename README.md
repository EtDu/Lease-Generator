# Lease Generator

## An Ethereum-based system to manage leases as a landlord and pay rent as a tenant. 

Lease Generator is a semi-automated system that allows landlords to create and manage multiple leases for their properties & tenants. Tenants may use this platform to pay their rent. Tenants must pay a lease deposit, which ensures they pay their rent on time. If they fail to make a payment before the deadline, the landlord may revoke the lease deposit. Once the lease is over, the tenant may reclaim the deposit.
